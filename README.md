# Higher or Lower game!

Welcome to the Higher or Lower Instagram Challenge! This Python program is a simple game where you'll be presented with two Instagram accounts, and your goal is to guess which account has more followers. Let's see how well you know your favorite influencers!

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Download the following files from this repository:
   - `main.py` (the main program)
   - `art.py` (contains ASCII art for the game)
   - `game_data.py` (contains data for the Instagram accounts)
3. Save all files in the same directory.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory where the files are located.
6. Run the program by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. You will be presented with two Instagram accounts for comparison.

2. Guess which account has more followers by typing 'a' or 'b' and press Enter.

3. If your guess is correct, your score will increase, and the game will continue with new accounts.

4. If your guess is incorrect, the game will end, and your final score will be displayed.
